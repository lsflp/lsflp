## Hi, there! I'm Luís 👋

I am a computer scientist from São Paulo, Brazil. I am currently on sabbatical, so I can work on myself and some personal projects (like learning how to ride a motorcyle!).

I'm a lifelong learner, always eager to discover and share. My interests include statistics, data visualization and data engineering. I've also been very interested in environmental issues recently.
